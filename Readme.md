# K2 Extruder Nozzle-Cam Project

This is my first attempt at doing a fork ever, from the k2 extruder nozzle-cam project, Everyone is welcome to improve, add or fix anything wrong in it. Work in progress.
## Installation

Run `sh ./install.sh` to drag all the required files over
Simple as that.

Below you will find a modified readme of the 3DO Nozzle Camera provided by 3DO's github.
Feel free to refer to the User Controls section for command functionality.
Results may vary depending on hardware installation, you will likely end up experimenting with different `set-ctrls` parameters set to your liking.
I'll be providing my commands used here for reference until such time as a front-end UI can me made to control the camera without touching the commandline.

- Use `v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-ctrls` to view the available commands, and their current set values.
- Use `v4l2-ctl --devicve=/dev/video0 -set-ctrl

## FPC Cable Options
- 5cm - Needs LED's
- 10cm - Needs LED's
- 25cm - Needs LED's
- 5cm with LEDs - Recommended (Needed for my mount) for K2 Plus

## Camera Options
- **Nozzle Camera (Glued)**: Not Recommended.
- **Nozzle Camera (Adjustable)**: Lens focus can be adjusted by rotating the lens. (Recommended, used on my mount)
- **Enclosure Camera (Adjustable)**: Lens focus can be adjusted by rotating the lens, FoV 120°. (not tested but I've been told its size is similar to the Nozzle camera so it might be compatible with my mount)

**Notes:**

- `exposure_time_absolute` controls the shutter speed and can only be set when `auto_exposure` is in manual mode.

- PTZ controls (`pan_absolute`, `tilt_absolute`, `zoom_absolute`) are used to crop the image. All 30fps streams are downscaled to 4K, and all 60fps streams are downscaled to 1080p. To use the crop feature, you need to select a downscaled stream.
